# **Python Assignment**

The folder `Scripts` contains the scripts for the different assignments for the python `Notebooks` **02** to **06** in [link](https://github.com/Fnyasimi/Python4Bioinformatics2019).

Each individual excercise has its own script and the different scripts are documented here.

## Python scripts

All these scripts were written using **Python 3**.

* `exercise02_gcpercent.py` is a script which can be used to calculate the GC and AT percentage content of a valid DNA sequence. When executing the script you are **prompted** to input your dna sequence. It can use in uppercase and lowercase.

* `exercise03.py` executing this script, generates a square of numbers **divisible by 3** between 0 and 100. It also generates a square of all **prime numbers** between 0 and 100.

* `exercise04_revcomp.py` is a script which is used to generate the reverse compliment of any valid DNA sequence. The DNA sequence yoush be complete with no gaps or ambiguous bases. Executing the script prompts the user to input the DNA sequence and it returns the reverse compliment.

* `exercise05_bank.py` this is an interactive python script which is used to manage bank **withdrawals**, **deposits**, and **checking bank balance**. A user can carry out any of the above transactions when the script is executed.

* `exercise05_loops.py` is used to generate loops and print each iteration to the console when executed. First loop prints **0-5**, second loop prints **0-10** but skips **5** and the last loop prints **4-10**.

* `exercise06_dna.py` is a script containing a defined function. The function `dnafunction()` is used to check if the sequence of interest is DNA or not. The function takes a string DNA as input.

* `exercise06_gc.py` is a script com=ntaining a fuction `gcfunction()` which is used to calculate the GC and AT percentage in a DNA sequence. The function takes a string DNA as input.
